Ask \n\n## Background\n\n*•*\tCompany: Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that \nare geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers \nwho purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\n*•*\tMy role: Junior data analyst working in the marketing analytics team\n\n*•*\tPremise: Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing (who is also my manager) believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. The director of marketing wants to Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members but to do this, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. So there’s need to analyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends\n\n## The Business Task: \nMy task is to analyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends that will help the marketing team to convert casual riders into members.\n\n## Key Stakeholders\n*•*\tPrimary stakeholder - the director of marketing (my manager)\n\n*•*\tSecondary stakeholders - the marketing analytics team and the executive team\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading the packages into R\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nlist.files(path = \"../input/cyclistic-dataset\")# Setting file directory\ngetwd() # displays your working directory","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-10T10:04:59.867727Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-10T10:04:59.870134Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-10T10:04:59.908447Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# STEP 1: COLLECT DATA\n\n## Data Source \nPrevious 12 months (from Oct, 2020 to Sept, 2021) of Cyclistic trip [data downloaded here.](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)\n\n## Important Notes\n*•*\tCyclistic is a fictional company thus the datasets name do not match\n\n*•*\tThe [dataset is licensed under this regulation](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) and has been publicly made available by Motivate International Inc.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Uploading Divvy datasets (csv files) here\nOct_2020_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Oct 2020.csv')\nNov_2020_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Nov 2020.csv')\nDec_2020_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Dec 2020.csv')\nJan_2021_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Jan 2021.csv')\nFeb_2021_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Feb 2021.csv')\nMar_2021_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Mar 2021.csv')\nApr_2021_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Apr 2021.csv')\nMay_2021_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/May 2021.csv')\nJun_2021_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Jun 2021.csv')\nJul_2021_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Jul 2021.csv')\nAug_2021_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Aug 2021.csv')\nSept_2021_tripdata <- read_csv('../input/cyclistic-dataset/Sept 2021.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-10T10:04:59.912281Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-10T10:04:59.913963Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-10T10:05:03.770977Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

Key takeaways:\n\n*•*\tThe average ride duration is higher for casual riders for any day of the week.\n\n*•*\tBoth members and casual riders preferred docked bikes, while the classic bike is the least popular bike type. \n\n*•*\tStreeter Dr & Grand Ave, Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, and Millennium Park are casual riders' top three start stations.\n\n*•*\tCasual riders ride more during the weekends.\n\n# Recommendations \n\n*•*\tGiving incentives or rewards for achieving members' milestones to attract casual riders to become members.\n\n*•*\tOffer occasional membership discount to new riders on summer and holiday weekends\n\n*•*\tPartner with local businesses within the top used stations for casual riders targeting 1) local casual riders, 2) frequent visitors (commuters) to the businesses.","metadata":{}}]}
